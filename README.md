# Advent of code 2021
I will try to do each day in a different language until I run out of languages.

[Day 1](https://github.com/MancunianSam/advent-of-code-2021/tree/main/scala) (Scala)
```
cd scala
sbt run
```

[Day 2](https://github.com/MancunianSam/advent-of-code-2021/tree/main/elixir) (Elixir)
```
cd elixir
mix run
```

[Day 3](https://github.com/MancunianSam/advent-of-code-2021/tree/main/rust) (Rust)
```
cd rust
cargo run
```

[Day 4](https://github.com/MancunianSam/advent-of-code-2021/tree/main/go) (Go)
```
cd go
go run .
```

[Day 5](https://github.com/MancunianSam/advent-of-code-2021/tree/main/ruby) (Ruby)
```
cd ruby 
ruby ruby.rb
```

[Day 6](https://github.com/MancunianSam/advent-of-code-2021/tree/main/c) (C)
```
cd c
gcc main.c -o main.out
./main.out
```

The solution for part two will also work for part one but I've left the original solution for part one in, even though it won't work for the second part.

[Day 7](https://github.com/MancunianSam/advent-of-code-2021/tree/main/c++) (C++)
```
cd c++
g++ main.cpp -o main.out
./main.out
```
