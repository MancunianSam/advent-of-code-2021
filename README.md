# Advent of code 2021
I will try to do each day in a different language until I run out of languages.

[Day 1](https://github.com/MancunianSam/advent-of-code-2021/tree/main/scala) (Scala)
```
cd scala
sbt run
```

[Day 2](https://github.com/MancunianSam/advent-of-code-2021/tree/main/elixir) (Elixir)
```
cd elixir
mix run
```
